# SccmTools

SccmTools provides a command for creating an SCCM 2012 application from a package definition file.

## Commands

### CreateApplicationFromDefinition

Create SCCM 2012 application from a package definition file. The PackageDefinition.sms format is documented here: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/bb632631.aspx. This command is useful in simpler script install scenarios where only an install and an uninstall command line is suffcient. Application detection method will be based on the msi product code of the installed msi or on a specified registry value. The msi product code on the format '{{...guid...}}', should be defined in the custom section key [DetectionMethod]MsiProductCode. If the product code is not manually defined, the msi product code will be attempted automatically retrieved from any msi file found by directory search of the content folder, the folder where the package definition file is located. If more than one msi file is found, an exception is thrown asking for manual definition of product code. If the content directory does not contain a msi file, a registry value can be defined as detection method by specifying the value [DetectionMethod]RegistryValue. The install script is in this case responsible for writing this registry value on install and removing the registry value on uninstall. The package definition file is required to have a [INSTALL] program and a [UNINSTALL] program. The following values are recognized and read from the package definition file: [Package Definition]Name, [Package Definition]Version, [Package Definition]Publisher, [Package Definition]Language, [Package Definition]Comment, [INSTALL]CommandLine, [INSTALL]Icon, [UNINSTALL]CommandLine, [DetectionMethod]MsiProductCode, [DetectionMethod]RegistryValue, [DetectionMethod]RegistryValueIs64Bit. The location of the package definition file must be on a network drive or an UNC path. The command will automatically derive the UNC path from a network drive.

The command can be run from:

* **Command line**
```
SccmTools.exe CreateApplicationFromDefinition /packageDefinitionFile="\\servername\appsource\Some Application 1.0\Pkg\PackageDefinition.sms" 
```
* **Windows Explorer context menu:**

* **Configuration Manager Console context menu:**

#### Recognized package definition values:
	
* [Package Definition]Name
* [Package Definition]Version
* [Package Definition]Publisher
* [Package Definition]Language
* [Package Definition]Comment
* [INSTALL]CommandLine
* [INSTALL]Icon
* [UNINSTALL]CommandLine
* [DetectionMethod]MsiProductCode
* [DetectionMethod]RegistryValue
* [DetectionMethod]RegistryValueIs64Bit
* [Dependencies]Dependency01
* [Dependencies]Dependency02
* ...
* [Dependencies]DependencyXX
		
All other values in package definition file are ignored.

                                  Application detection method will be based
                                  on the msi product code of the installed
                                  msi or on a specified registry value. The

                                  '{...guid...}', should be defined in the

                                  product code. If the content directory does
                                  not contain a msi file, a registry value
                                  can be defined as detection method by
                                  specifying the value
                                  [DetectionMethod]RegistryValue. The install
                                  script is in this case responsible for

                                  removing the registry value on uninstall.
                                  The package definition file is required to
                                  have a [INSTALL] program and a [UNINSTALL]
                                  program. The following values are
                                  recognized and read from the package
                                  definition file: [Package Definition]Name,
                                  [Package Definition]Version, [Package
                                  Definition]Publisher, [Package

                                  must be on a network drive or an UNC path.
                                  The command will automatically derive the
                                  UNC path from a network drive.
   /packageDefinitionFile         [Optional] Package definition file as

                                  It is required that file path is a unc path
                                  or on a network drive. If this package
                                  definition file is not specified on the

                                  Default value:

   Example: SccmTools.exe CreateApplicationFromDefinition /packageDefinitionFile="\\servername\appsource\Some Application 1.0\Pkg\PackageDefinition.sms"
