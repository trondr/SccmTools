## Commands

### CreateApplicationFromDefinition

Create a SCCM 2012 application from a package definition file. The PackageDefinition.sms format is documented here: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/bb632631.aspx. This is useful in simpler script install scenarios where only install and uninstall command line is necessary and the application is installed by a msi file. Application detection method will be based on the msi product code. The msi product  code on the format '{...guid...}', can be stored in the custom section key [DetectionMethod]MsiProductCode or can be  manually defined anywhere in the [Package Definition]Comment value. If the product  code is not manually defined, the msi product code will be attempted automatically retrieved from the msi file found by directory search of the content folder, the folder where the package definition file is located. If more than one msi file is found, an exception is thrown asking for manual definition of  product code. The package definition file is required to have a [INSTALL] program and a [UNINSTALL] program. The following values are recognized and read from the package definition file: [Package Definition]Name, [Package Definition]Version, [Package Definition]Publisher, [Package Definition]Language, [Package Definition]Comment=<msi product code can be provided somewhere in this comment field>, [INSTALL]CommandLine, [INSTALL]Icon, [UNINSTALL]CommandLine.

The command can be run from:

* **Command line**
```
SccmTools.exe CreateApplicationFromDefinition /packageDefinitionFile="\\servername\appsource\Some Application 1.0\Pkg\PackageDefinition.sms" 
```
* **Windows Explorer context menu:**

* **Configuration Manager Console context menu:**

#### Recognized package definition values:
	
* [Package Definition]Name
* [Package Definition]Version
* [Package Definition]Publisher
* [Package Definition]Language
* [INSTALL]CommandLine
* [INSTALL]Icon
* [UNINSTALL]CommandLine
* [DetectionMethod]MsiProductCode
		
All other values in package definition file are ignored.
